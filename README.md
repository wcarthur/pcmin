# Potential intensity of tropical cyclones

This code is used to calculate the potential intensity of tropical cyclones (TCs), using the code published by Kerry Emanuel. It is essentially a wrapper around the FORTRAN subroutine provided in the links below, for use with ERA5 Replicated Data: Single and pressure-levels data available at the National Computational Facility (NCI) (project `rt52`).

The code is intended to be run on the NCI's `gadi` machine, with access to `rt52`. There is a significant amount of bespoke code in this, designed around the folder structure and actual data holdings of the ERA5 data at NCI.

For example, pressure level data is held only for a limited subdomain over Australia and southeast Asia, while surface variables have global coverage. This requires some trick manipulation of the coordinate indices to ensure they align correctly.

Note also the pressure level data is ordered from lowest pressure to highest pressure - highest to lowest altitude. The `pcmin.f` subroutine requires the input to be in the opposite order. Before using the code here, please check the ordering of the pressure level data.

### Dependencies

* python-netCDF4
* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* cftime
* mpi4py
* gitpython
* seaborn
* cartopy
* shapely
* matplotlib

### Installation

We use the standard Python setup tools to build the extension, making use of the `numpy.f2py` module to automatically wrap the FORTRAN code with a Python interface. You can build the Pyhton wrapper using a standard python setup call:

`python setup.py install`

### Running the code

Set up a suitable configuration file (see `calculate.ini`). In many cases, I suspect users will need to do more than simply update the configuration file to get this running. The configuration file is currently only used to specify top-level input paths, output location and the logging settings. Other Sections/Options are currently not used.

Run

`python calculate.py -h` 

for a basic description of command line arguments.

To run in a parallel environment:

```shell
mpirun -np <ncpus> python calculate.py -c calculate.ini -y <year>
```

`calc_pi.sh` is a shell script that loops through the available years and calculates daily PI values. It's a self-submitting script that runs the above command line, so each year is completed as a separate job. This reduces the walltime of submitted jobs to within queue limits. 

```shell
qsub -v NJOB=1,NJOBS=41,YEAR=1979 calc_pi.sh
``` 


### Averaging data

There are also a couple of shell scripts, built around either `cdo` or `nco`, to calculate monthly means and daily long term means. Again, these are intended for use on the NCI's gadi platform (and using the PBS queuing system), so your mileage may vary.

As a general rule, the `nco` tools are faster to calculate means, etc., but `cdo` provides a more intuitive command line experience, especially when calculating statistics other than simple means.

`calculate_daily_ltm.sh` calculates a daily long term mean of potential intensity.

`calculate_means.sh` calculates monthly mean values for all available date ranges, monthly long term means, standard deviation and (10th and 90th) percentiles, trends and time series of trend for a number of sub-regions.
